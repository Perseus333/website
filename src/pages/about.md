I like building and creating stuff. Usually I will post it [in this website](#) or in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@perseuslynx). I'm interested in engineering as well as philosophy. You should find a good mixture of both in my [blog](/blog). I enjoy doing [projects](/projects) for fun, if you'd like to collaborate with any, feel free to [contact me](/contact).

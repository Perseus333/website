> I'm an aerospace student that is more invested into programming than it should be.

I like building and creating stuff. Usually I will post it [here](#) or in my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdHzS2hrSC5ovPpvxNnuZWg). I'm interested in engineering and STEM as well as philosophy. You should find a good mixture of both in my [blog](/blog).

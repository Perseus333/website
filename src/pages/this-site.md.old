This website aims to be an online-archive of my various projects, ideas and identity. 

I will try to be active on it long-term. *(famous last words)*

It was inspired by the following websites:
- [refact0r.dev](https://refact0r.dev)
- [The Monospace Web](https://owickstrom.github.io/the-monospace-web/)
- [Fehmer's Keyboards](https://keebs.fehmer.info/)
- [MemetrollXD's website](https://memetrolls.net/)

This website was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

You can find the repository of this website [on my GitHub repo](https://github.com/Perseus333/website).

You can find the analytics of the website [on the umami dashboard](https://cloud.umami.is/share/WFgcWwn2qH6fhT2c/perseus333.github.io).

This website is part of the Catppuccin webring!

## Design Philosophy

I'm still deciding on it as this website progresses but for now this are my guidelines:

### Simplicity

The important text should be readable, and a simple website enables that by being easy on the eyes.

- It should contain little to no animations
- Colors should be limited
- Default to dark theme

Simplicity is also carried to the website itself. 

- It should be a static website
- Simple framework (like Jekyll)
- Contain little to no JS

All of this should create:

- Fast page loads
- Easy mantainability
- C L E A N

### It's own identity

It should have a unique style that doesn't sacrifice simplicity.

Modern websites all look the same.

- Cold colors on white
- `border-radius: 50%;`
- Crazy padding
- Way to many animations

### Customizable

The user should be able to tweak the website to their liking without compromising simplicity.

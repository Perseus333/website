A simple task manager for the terminal. It's coded in C and has a monolithic design.

The main objective of this project was to practice C, specifically my ability to make clean and readable code. I reckon this was achieved, as a community member was able to read through the code and fix some issues.

Even though it's very simple in design and there are thousands of nearly-identical projects online, I use it on a regular basis for small tasks.

In this project I integrated new concepts to me such as: Enumeration, proper error messages, path validation, but above all, string manipulation. Also, thanks to the contributions I learned about installing programs through a Makefile.

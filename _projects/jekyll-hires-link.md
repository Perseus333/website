Jekyll High-res Link is a pluging for Jekyll that wraps images with a link that redirects them to the original uncompressed image. You require to have both versions of the image for this to work. Although you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/Perseus333/8a161ffa160b0d2f6c2fd3c9756b1568) to make the two versions of the images. In v0.2.0, an implementation of this script on Ruby will be added for those that prefer a more seamless solution. More information on how to use the gem is provided at the README of the project.

I made it just to implement it on this website since I didn't want to have any more JavaScript. If you want to hear the story behind this plugin, see my blog post about [minifying this website](/blog/minifying-website).
